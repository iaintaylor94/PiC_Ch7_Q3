# Programming in C
## Chapter 7
### Question 3

This problem is from chapter 7 of the textbook, it is to modify program 7.2[^1] from the textbook to accept any number of responses.

You may wish to run the program and compare its output.

This programhas a serious error: when running the code the output is correct, however there is also an error message (stack smashing detected). I am unsure of the cause of this error, however since it is outside the scope of this exercise and the fact that the rest of the output is correct I am going to proceed to the next exercise in the textbook.
